            <h5>General notice</h5>


            Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data protection regulations of the Swiss
            Confederation (Data Protection Act, DSG), every person has the right to protection of their privacy as well
            as protection against misuse of their personal data. The operators of these pages take the protection of
            your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the
            legal data protection regulations as well as this privacy policy.
            In cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to protect the databases as well as possible
            against unauthorized access, loss, misuse or falsification.
            We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have
            security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
            By using this website, you consent to the collection, processing and use of data in accordance with the
            following description. This website can generally be visited without registration. Data such as pages viewed
            or names of files accessed, date and time are stored on the server for statistical purposes without this
            data being directly related to your person. Personal data, in particular name, address or e-mail address are
            collected as far as possible on a voluntary basis. No data will be passed on to third parties without your
            consent.
            Processing of personal data
            Personal data is any information that relates to a specific or identifiable person. A data subject is a
            person about whom personal data is processed. Processing includes any handling of personal data, regardless
            of the means and procedures used, in particular the storage, disclosure, acquisition, deletion, storage,
            modification, destruction and use of personal data.
            We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law. Furthermore, to the extent and
            insofar as the EU GDPR is applicable, we process personal data in accordance with the following legal bases
            in connection with Art. 6 (1) GDPR:

            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>lit. a) Processing of personal data with the consent of the data subject.</li>
                <li>lit. b) Processing of personal data for the fulfillment of a contract with the data subject as well
                    as for the implementation of corresponding pre-contractual measures.</li>
                <li>lit. c) Processing of personal data for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which we are
                    subject under any applicable law of the EU or under any applicable law of a country in which the
                    GDPR is applicable in whole or in part.</li>
                <li>lit. d) Processing of personal data in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or
                    another natural person.</li>
                <li>lit. f) Processing of personal data to protect the legitimate interests of us or of third parties,
                    unless the fundamental freedoms and rights and interests of the data subject are overridden.
                    Legitimate interests include, in particular, our business interest in being able to provide our
                    website, information security, the enforcement of our own legal claims and compliance with Swiss
                    law.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We process personal data for the duration required for the respective purpose or purposes. In the case of
                longer-term retention obligations due to legal and other obligations to which we are subject, we
                restrict processing accordingly.</p>

            <h5>Privacy policy for cookies</h5>
            <p>
                This website uses cookies. These are small text files that make it possible to store specific
                information related to the user on the user’s terminal device while the user is using the website.
                Cookies make it possible, in particular, to determine the frequency of use and number of users of the
                pages, to analyze behavior patterns of page use, but also to make our offer more customer-friendly.
                Cookies remain stored beyond the end of a browser session and can be retrieved when you visit the site
                again. If you do not wish this to happen, you should set your Internet browser so that it refuses to
                accept cookies.
                A general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be declared for a large
                number of the services, especially in the case of tracking, via the U.S. site
                http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU site http://www.youronlinechoices.com/. Furthermore, the
                storage of cookies can be achieved by disabling them in the browser settings. Please note that in this

            <h5>Privacy policy for SSL/TLS encryption</h5>
            <p>
                This website uses SSL/TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of
                confidential content, such as inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an
                encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “http://” to
                “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
                If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
            </p>
            <h5>Copyrights</h5>
            <p>
                The copyrights and all other rights to content, images, photos or other files on the website, belong
                exclusively to the operator of this website or the specifically named rights holders. For the
                reproduction of any files, the written consent of the copyright holder must be obtained in advance.
                Anyone who commits a copyright infringement without the consent of the respective copyright holder may
                be liable to prosecution and possibly to damages.
            </p>
            <h5>Changes</h5>
            <p>We may amend this privacy policy at any time without prior notice. The current version published on our
                website shall apply. Insofar as the data protection declaration is part of an agreement with you, we
                will inform you of the change by e-mail or other suitable means in the event of an update.</p>
            <h5>Questions to the data protection officer</h5>
            <p>If you have any questions regarding data protection, please write us an email or contact directly the
                responsible person in our organization listed for data protection at the beginning of the Privacy
                Policy.
